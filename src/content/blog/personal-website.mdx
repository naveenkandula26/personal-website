Having a personal website is more than just having an online presence—it's a space to showcase my work, document my journey, and connect with others.

## Why I Built It

I created my personal website for several reasons:

- **Showcasing My Work** – A central place to display my projects and experiences.
- **Building My Online Presence** – A professional identity beyond social media.
- **Sharing Knowledge** – Writing about web development, React, and other topics.
- **Learning & Experimentation** – A playground to test new technologies and design ideas.

```tsx
const website = "My Personal Space";
const reason = "Showcase, Learn, and Connect";
console.log(`${website}: ${reason}`);
```

This website is an evolving project, and I'm excited to keep improving it. Stay tuned for updates!
