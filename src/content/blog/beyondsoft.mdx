# 🚀 Beyondsoft: My First Job as a Frontend Developer

## **Introduction**

My first job was at **[Beyondsoft](https://www.beyondsoft.com/)**, an MNC based in China, while I was located in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**. I was outsourced to **[Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/)**, a Fortune 500 company, working on large-scale projects with millions of users.

---

## **Landing My First Job** 🎯

During my internship, I received several job opportunities from different headhunters. One of them was from **Beyondsoft**. After discussing the opportunity, I was intrigued by the idea of working closely with **Tencent** and learning how large-scale projects operate. So, I decided to go for the interview.

### **Interview Process**
1. **First Round (2 hours, Tencent interviewers)**  
   - Discussed my **internship experience** and personal projects.  
   - Technical questions on **React, TypeScript**, and a coding challenge on **LeetCode**.  
2. **Second Round (2 hours, Senior Manager from Tencent)**  
   - Behavioral interview with questions about **career goals** and long-term plans.  

**Key Lesson Learned:**  
🔹 Communication is just as important as technical skills! Explaining my thought process clearly helped me stand out.  

---

## **First Impressions & Expectations** 👨‍💻

I initially expected to jump straight into big projects, but I quickly realized that **onboarding** was a crucial step.  

### **First-week experience:**
- Setting up my **development environment**  
- Understanding the **codebase**  
- Learning the **team workflows**  

🚀 One major difference from my internship was working on a **huge project with cutting-edge technology** and **millions of users**.  

---

## **Tech Stack & Work Environment** 🛠️

At **Tencent**, we use:  

- **Frontend Technologies:** React (Umi.js, Taro.js), TypeScript, Ant Design (antd)
- **State Management:** Redux and Context API  
- **Backend Integration:** RESTful API  
- **Collaboration Tools:** Git, Jira, Figma  

🔹 **Working in a real-world environment** taught me how to write **clean, scalable code** and effectively collaborate with backend developers and designers.  

---

## **Challenges Faced** 😓

### **1️⃣ Overcoming the Language & Communication Barrier (语言问题)**  

Since most of my teammates were from China, I quickly realized that their **work style and terminology** were quite different from what I was familiar with during my internship. As a fresh graduate still adapting to **scrum methodologies**, it was initially challenging to fully grasp their discussions, especially during **meetings and technical presentations**.  

The biggest difficulty was that I couldn’t always **interrupt the conversation** to ask for clarifications in real-time. This often left me struggling to catch up with key points and action items.  

#### **Common Phrases I Encountered** 🗣️  
During work discussions, I frequently came across expressions like:  
- **协议发我看看** - _Send the protocol to me_  
- **构建仪表到预发** - _Build and deploy the dashboard to pre-release_  
- **先和产品确认** - _Confirm with the product team first_  
- **拉个会捋一下进展** - _Pull a meeting to discuss the progress_  

Additionally, many technical terms were widely used but unfamiliar to me, such as:  
- **构建** - _Build_  
- **分支** - _Branch_  
- **特性** - _Feature_  
- **杂务** - _Miscellaneous tasks_  
- **仪表** - _Dashboard_  
- **宽表** - _Wide table_  
- **落地** - _Implementation_  

To overcome this challenge, I:  
✅ **Took notes** during meetings and researched unfamiliar terms later.  
✅ **Asked teammates privately** when I needed clarification.  

🔹 **Lesson Learned:** Adapting to a new work culture takes time, but being **proactive in learning technical vocabulary** and improving communication skills makes a huge difference.  


### **2️⃣ Navigating a Large & Complex Codebase**  

One of the biggest challenges I faced early on was adapting to a **massive codebase** with intricate architecture, custom SDKs, and complex business logic. Unlike my internship projects, where I worked on smaller, more contained applications, this was a whole new level of complexity.  

#### **Key Challenges I Encountered**  

🛠 **Micro-Frontend Architecture**  
The project followed a **micro-frontend architecture**, which meant different parts of the application were managed independently by various teams. This introduced challenges such as:  
- Understanding how different modules **communicate and interact** with each other.  
- Debugging issues that spanned multiple **micro-frontends**.  
- Learning the internal **SDKs** that abstracted functionalities across different platforms.  

🔄 **Coordinating with Multiple Teams Across Time Zones**  
Since this was a large-scale enterprise project, collaboration was essential. I frequently worked with:  
- **Development team** – to integrate new features and debug issues.  
- **Product team** – to understand feature requirements and business logic.  
- **Design team** – to ensure UI consistency and feasibility.  
- **Testing team** – to validate implementations and fix bugs.  
- Teams from different companies and **time zones**, requiring asynchronous communication and clear documentation.  

⚙️ **Highly Configurable Features**  
Unlike static applications, this project allowed users to **customize layouts, functionalities, and workflows** based on their preferences. This meant:  
- Features were designed to be modular and flexible.  
- The UI/UX needed to adapt dynamically based on user settings.  
- Debugging was challenging because each user had a **different configuration** and experience.  

#### **How I Adapted**  

✅ **Broke down the codebase into smaller sections** to study how different parts connected.  
✅ **Read internal documentation and past pull requests** to understand existing patterns.  
✅ **Used debugging tools** to trace logic and API calls across different micro-frontends.  
✅ **Regularly communicated with senior developers** to clarify doubts and learn best practices.  

🔹 **Lesson Learned:** Understanding a large-scale codebase requires patience and strategy. Breaking it down into manageable parts and collaborating with different teams significantly speeds up the learning process.  

### **3️⃣ Configurable Features**
- **Dynamic layouts** and **feature toggles** required extra debugging.  
- Had to learn how to **manage state efficiently** for different user configurations.  

### **4️⃣ Performance Optimization**
- Learning how to **minimize re-renders** in React  
- Measuring performance using **DevTools & Profiling**  

---

## **Growth & Achievements** 📈

One of my proudest moments was **contributing to a key feature** within my first few months. Seeing my code go live and impact real users was an amazing experience.  

### **Skills I Improved:**
✅ **Debugging skills** - Mastering Chrome **DevTools**  
✅ **Code readability** - Writing **cleaner, reusable components**  
✅ **Performance optimization** - Using **hooks efficiently** to reduce re-renders  
✅ **Collaboration** - Actively participating in **code reviews and discussions**

## **My Thoughts on the Job** 💭

**Career Development:**
- Learning how **large-scale projects** work  
- Collaborating across multiple teams  
- Using **modern technologies** and **best practices**  

**Salary:** 💰 **RM 4,800** - Higher than the average salary for fresh graduates in Malaysia.
